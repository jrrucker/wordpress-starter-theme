# Starter WordPress Theme

This starter theme is a basic WordPress theme I created to quickly start development on new themes while I was working at NC State.  SInce then, I've made some modiication to generalize it for wider use.  There isn't much to it except a basic theme structure, a Grunt task for CSS compilation and JavaScript minification, and few common dependencies like JQuery and Bootstrap. Feel free to fork and modify as you please under the MIT license.

## Get Started

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Run `npm install -g bower` to install Bower.
1. Run `npm install` to install Grunt and other node dependencies.
1. Run `bower install` to install dev. dependencies.
1. Run `grunt` to compile CSS and add watcher for changes to CSS and JavaScript.
